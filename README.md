## Introduction

This repository contains a series of question sets covering various SAP domains such as **ABAP**, **AI**, **BASIS**, **BTP**, **Security**, and general **Common** SAP topics.

**Highlights:**
- Covers multiple SAP specializations, from classical on-prem ABAP to modern cloud-based solutions like BTP.
- Includes question sets that range from beginner-friendly fundamentals to advanced enterprise scenarios.
- Each set is designed for self-study, workshop preparation, or interview readiness.
